            Problem/Data Domain
        </h2>
        <p>
            RSOs on campus play a key role in fostering community through diverse events and activities, from educational workshops to social gatherings. However, a significant challenge faced by these organizations is the effectiveness of scheduling and publicizing the events. The current situation lacks a centralized, efficient system for RSOs to manage their events. Leading to issues such as overlapping schedules, insufficient attendance, and missed opportunities for community engagement.

            The primary challenge in this domain is the absence of a dedicated platform that caters specifically to the needs of RSOs in organizing and people in discovering events within the campus community Existing solutions like reddit, UW websites, and other social medias are often generic and not tailored to the unique dynamics of student organizations, which require easy coordination, wide visibility among the audience group, and tools for effective communication and engagement. This gap in technology solutions hinders the ability of RSOs to maximize their impact, reach their intended audience, and foster a sense of community through their events.

            As members of various RSOs, we have firsthand experience with the difficulties in scheduling and promoting events. We have observed that platforms like discord, university website, and general social media are insufficient for these purposes. They either lack the specificity needed for effective RSO event management or fail to engage the student community adequately.

            Proposed Application

        <p>Heres how our community planner works!</p>
        <h3> Potential User Interactions </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create and Upload Events: Registered RSOs would get to create and upload their events to the calendar provided on the website.
                They would have to click on a date and provide the event details as prompted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Register and Add Events: Interested students could sign up by clicking on the event and providing their contact information to
                be registered before the event gets added to their personal calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Get Event Updates: A notification system would be set up for students who have signed up for events,
                where they receive notifications about event reminders and updates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Search for Events: Users would get to search for events they want specifically or by a specific RSO.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As we develop an application exclusively for UW students interested in RSO events,
            the primary source of information will be derived from UW students who organize and participate in these events.
            The data will encompass details such as event descriptions,
            timings, locations, organizers, and participant information.
            The application relies solely on internal resources, specifically the input and interaction of UW students involved in RSOs.
            No external resources, such as CSV files or APIs, are required for the application's functionality.
        </p>
        <h3>Potential Benefits</h3>
        <p>
            Using this app will help solve the problem of ineffective scheduling and publicizing of events for Registered Student Organizations
