        <h3> Potential User Interactions </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create and Upload Events: Registered RSOs would get to create and upload their events to the calendar provided on the website. 
                They would have to click on a date and provide the event details as prompted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Register and Add Events: Interested students could sign up by clicking on the event and providing their contact information to 
                be registered before the event gets added to their personal calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Get Event Updates: A notification system would be set up for students who have signed up for events, 
                where they receive notifications about event reminders and updates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Search for Events: Users would get to search for events they want specifically or by a specific RSO.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As we develop an application exclusively for UW students interested in RSO events, 
            the primary source of information will be derived from UW students who organize and participate in these events. 
            The data will encompass details such as event descriptions, 
            timings, locations, organizers, and participant information. 
            The application relies solely on internal resources, specifically the input and interaction of UW students involved in RSOs. 
            No external resources, such as CSV files or APIs, are required for the application's functionality. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Using this app will help solve the problem of ineffective scheduling and publicizing of events for Registered Student Organizations 
            (RSOs) on campus. The features provided address the specific challenges faced by RSOs and offer a tailored solution to enhance event management 
            and community engagement, including:

                        Centralized Event Management: 
                    </a>
                    the ability to create and upload events provides RSOs with a centralized platform to manage their events efficiently. 
                    This feature ensures that all relevant information about an event is available in one place, reducing the chances of miscommunication or missed details.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improved Visibility and Coordination: the feature of allowing individuals to easily sign up for events 
                    and add them to their calendars enhances visibility and coordination, helping to prevent overlapping schedules and 
                    ensuring that interested participants can plan their attendance effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Effective Communication: the notification system keeps members informed about event updates, ensuring that any changes or important information are promptly communicated. 
                    This feature helps address the challenge of insufficient attendance by keeping participants engaged and informed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tailored Search Functionality: this functionality allows users to discover events based on their interests and preferences. 
                    This addresses the issue of generic platforms by providing a specific search mechanism tailored to the unique dynamics of student organizations.
